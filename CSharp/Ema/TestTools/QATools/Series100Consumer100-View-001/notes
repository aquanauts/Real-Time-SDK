# Linux

Two required and one recommended change are necessary for EmaConfig.xml:
(required) The host and port for the channel used by the consumer must point to the ADS used for this testing.
(required) XmlTraceToStdout must be set to one for the consumer; the verifyTest.py script uses this output
(recommended) reading the dictionary from the file system

to generate the test output: ./Cons100 > out
to verify that the output is correct: ./verifyTest.py
verifyTest.py assumes that the test output was written to a file named out
if verifyTest.py returns zero, then the test succeeded.
